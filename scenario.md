### Project management scenario
 1.  By entering the software, the registration operation must be done first
 
 2.  In the next step, defining the columns is enough and then we create the card. To manage each card, which is a task, we can do a variety of things.

3.  To avoid crowding and congestion of cards, we can archive the card whose files are closed to make the board more empty in terms of the number of cards.By archiving the cards, they will not be deleted forever.

 4. The "Delete" option has been created in the app, and to completely delete the card or work, we must first archive the desired card and then delete it with another click.
