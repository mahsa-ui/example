### Project management scenario
 1. In the first step, it is enough to define columns and in the next step, we create cards. To manage each card, which is a task, we can do all kinds of things.

2.  To avoid crowding and congestion of cards, we can archive the card whose files are closed to make the board more empty in terms of the number of cards.By archiving the cards, they will not be deleted forever.

 3. The "Delete" option is created, and to completely delete a card or task, we must first archive the desired card and then delete it with another click.
